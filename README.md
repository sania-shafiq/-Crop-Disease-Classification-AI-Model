# 🌾 Crop Disease Classification AI Model

## Project Description

This project focuses on building an **AI-powered crop disease classification system** using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
It processes crop images, trains multiple machine learning algorithms, and accurately detects and classifies diseases to help farmers and agronomists make informed decisions.
